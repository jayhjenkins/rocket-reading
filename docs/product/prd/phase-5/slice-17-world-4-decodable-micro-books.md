# Slice 17: World 4 Decodable Micro-Books

## Overview
3–5 decodable micro-books using World 4 vocabulary (CVC + digraph/blend + tricky words + sentences).

## Contents
- Create 3–5 micro-books using:
  - CVC, digraph/blend, and tricky words.
  - Simple 2–3 sentence narratives (e.g., "The Fish," "I Shop With Mom," "My Cat Sat").
- Examples: "The Shop," "I See the Fish," "Mom is in the Car," "The Big Cat."
- Each book: 2–3 pages, 3–8 words per page, illustrations tied to comprehension.
- Child reads the book; parent checks comprehension (tap matching picture, answer simple question).
- Successful reads unlock book in the Treehouse bookshelf.
- Books can use **personalization** (e.g., "I shop with [Mom/Grandma]" if those names are in the decodable set).
- Sessions optionally end with choosing a micro-book to read.

## Why This Order
World 4 is now pedagogically complete—tricky words + sentence fluency + real-world context. Micro-books prove that kids can read short, connected narratives independently. This is a **major milestone**: they've progressed from letters → words → sentences → *stories*.

## Validation Criteria
- **Pedagogical:** Can kids read multi-sentence connected text with comprehension?
- **Engagement:** Do kids feel like "real readers" now?
- **Architecture:** Does the book system handle mixed word types (decodable + tricky)?
