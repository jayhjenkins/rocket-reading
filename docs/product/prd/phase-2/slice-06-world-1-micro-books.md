# Slice 6: World 1 Micro-Books (Read-Aloud Stories)

## Overview
Add simple, decodable micro-stories that the app reads aloud to the child, with illustrations.

## Contents
- Create 3–5 tiny micro-books for World 1 (no decoding required; app reads aloud).
- Each book: 1–3 pages, simple narrative, bright illustrations.
- Examples: "Luna's Day," "Garden Seeds," "Forest Friends."
- Books use **familiar letter-sounds and objects** from completed World 1 quests (visual callback to what the child has learned).
- At session end, parent can optionally let child "choose" a book to hear (makes the Treehouse bookshelf feel alive).
- Child can tap words to hear them spoken (scaffold for later decoding).

## Why This Order
World 1 is pedagogically complete, but there's no narrative payoff yet. Micro-books give kids a story experience while reinforcing letter knowledge. This also preps the infrastructure for World 2, where kids will actually *read* the micro-books.

## Validation Criteria
- **Engagement:** Do kids like listening to stories about characters they've helped?
- **Pedagogy:** Does narrative context help reinforce letter-sound knowledge?
- **Architecture:** Does the micro-book system scale when we transition to *readable* books in World 2?
