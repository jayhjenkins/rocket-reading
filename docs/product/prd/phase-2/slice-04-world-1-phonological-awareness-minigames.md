# Slice 4: World 1 Phonological Awareness Mini-Games

## Overview
Add 2 more mini-game types focused on phonological awareness (the non-written, sound-based skills that World 1 emphasizes).

## Contents
- New mini-games:
  1. **Same/Different** – App plays two sounds; child taps "Same" or "Different."
  2. **First Sound** – App plays a word (e.g., "cat"); child taps the letter that matches the first sound.
- These new games are mixed into World 1 quests alongside the existing Letter → Sound and Sound → Letter games.
- Sessions now use a wider variety of mini-games, all feeding into the same SR item pool.
- World 1 still targets 8–12 letters, but now with richer phonological awareness practice.

## Why This Order
World 1 is pedagogically about *phonological awareness*, not decoding. You've proven letters work; now you validate that phonological awareness games fit into the same quest/SR framework without breaking anything. Plus, variety keeps engagement high.

## Validation Criteria
- **Fun:** Does variety in mini-games keep kids engaged longer?
- **Pedagogical:** Do phonological awareness games show learning signals similar to letter-sound matching?
- **Architecture:** Does the quest generator handle heterogeneous mini-game types cleanly?
