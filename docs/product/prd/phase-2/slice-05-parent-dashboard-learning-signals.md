# Slice 5: Parent Dashboard & Learning Signals

## Overview
Parent-facing dashboard showing SR progress, weak items, and reading signals.

## Contents
- Parent can unlock dashboard (behind a simple gate).
- Dashboard shows:
  - **Overview:** Sessions played this week, average session length.
  - **Letter-Sound Knowledge:** "Strong: m, a, t, s. Growing: p, i. Needs practice: n, o."
  - **Weak items:** "Often misses: /o/, /i/. Try again tomorrow."
  - **Suggested action:** "Practice /i/ with these sounds. Point them out around the house."
- All data is pulled directly from SR engine (no manual work).
- Parent can optionally trigger a "focus quest" on a specific weak letter.

## Why This Order
You've proven the SR engine works (Slices 1–4). Now you validate that *parents can see and trust the data*. This is critical for the "learning validation" goal. Without a dashboard, parents don't know if the SR is actually working.

## Validation Criteria
- **Pedagogical:** Are the dashboard signals accurate? Do they match what parents observe?
- **Trust:** Can parents use this to guide practice outside the app?
- **Architecture:** Does pulling data from SR for display work smoothly?
