# Slice 10: World 2 Decodable Micro-Books

## Overview
3–5 simple decodable micro-books where the child actually reads (not just listens).

## Contents
- Create 3–5 micro-books using only CVC words + high-frequency words (the, is, a, my).
- Examples: "Cat on a Mat," "Dog and Bug," "I See a Cat."
- Each book: 1–3 pages, 2–4 words per page, bright illustrations.
- Child reads the book; parent or system checks comprehension (tap matching picture).
- Successful reads unlock book in the Treehouse bookshelf.
- Books can use **personalization** (if "Luna" is a CVC-decodable name or has been taught, it appears; otherwise generic pet names).
- Sessions optionally end with choosing a micro-book to read.

## Why This Order
World 2's pedagogical payoff is reading *connected text*, not just isolated words. Micro-books prove that kids can apply CVC decoding to real stories. This also preps for Epoch 2 (sentence-level SR items).

## Validation Criteria
- **Pedagogical:** Can kids read connected CVC text? Does it reinforce word knowledge?
- **Engagement:** Do kids feel proud reading their own books?
- **Architecture:** Does the book system work with personalization?
