# Slice 8: World 2 Foundation – CVC Decoding Mini-Games

## Overview
All CVC-focused mini-games (Blend the Word, Word Reading) + ~40 decodable CVC words in SR.

## Contents
- Expand SR item library to ~40 CVC words (cat, dog, mat, sit, run, big, etc.).
- New mini-games:
  1. **Blend the Word** – Child drags letter tiles into boxes, app segments sounds, child blends aloud, parent grades.
  2. **Word Reading (Isolated)** – Large word shown; child reads aloud; parent grades (or Adventure Mode picks matching picture).
- World 2 overworld unlocks: **Beaver Bridge, Duck Pond, Luna's Bed** locations.
- Sessions mix Word Reading + Blend the Word + Letter-Sound reviews (from World 1, now in maintenance).
- CVC word completion logic: when child hits ≥90% accuracy on 30 CVC words, World 2 is ready for progression.

## Why This Order
World 1 proved letter knowledge works. Now you validate that *decoding* (phoneme blending → word recognition) works within the same SR + quest framework. The mini-games are new, but the SR engine is unchanged.

## Validation Criteria
- **Pedagogical:** Can kids blend sounds into words? Does SR spacing help?
- **Engagement:** Are the new mini-games more engaging than letter-sounds?
- **Architecture:** Do new mini-game types integrate smoothly?
