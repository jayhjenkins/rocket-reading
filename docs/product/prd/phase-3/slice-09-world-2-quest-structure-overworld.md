# Slice 9: World 2 Quest Structure & Overworld

## Overview
Wrap CVC mini-games in quests, build Beaver Bridge + Duck Pond + Luna's Bed locations with persistence.

## Contents
- Overworld expands with 3 new locations:
  1. **Beaver Bridge** – Beaver quest: "Help me build my bridge by picking the right plank!" → Word Reading mini-games.
  2. **Duck Pond** – Duck quest: "Herd the ducks back to the pond!" → Word Reading/categorization.
  3. **Luna's Bed** – Child's dog quest: "Help Luna find her bed!" → Blend the Word + Word Reading.
- Quest generator pulls due CVC words, wraps them thematically.
- World state persists: bridge gets longer, ducks gather, Luna settles in bed.
- Sessions are ~7–12 minutes now (more items, more quests).
- World 1 quests still available (letters in maintenance).

## Why This Order
You've proven CVC mini-games work; now you validate that quests *integrate new mechanics smoothly*. World 2 is starting to feel like a fuller game with multiple locations and ongoing narratives.

## Validation Criteria
- **Fun:** Do World 2 quests feel distinct from World 1? Are kids motivated by progress?
- **Architecture:** Does the quest generator handle mixed mini-game types?
- **Retention:** Are World 1 items properly in maintenance, or are they crowding out World 2 practice?
