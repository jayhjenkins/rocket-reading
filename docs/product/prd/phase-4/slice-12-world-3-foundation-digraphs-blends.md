# Slice 12: World 3 Foundation – Digraphs & Consonant Blends

## Overview
Introduce digraph and blend letter patterns + new mini-game + ~30 decodable CCVC/CVCC words in SR.

## Contents
- Expand SR item library to ~30 CCVC/CVCC words using digraphs and blends (ship, fish, shop, stop, clap, frog, plant, etc.).
- Introduce new **letter pattern items** (not single letters, but **digraphs as units**: sh, ch, th, wh and blends: st, pl, tr, dr, etc.).
- New mini-game: **Blend Complex Words** (similar to Slice 8's "Blend the Word," but now with 4–5 letter tiles and multi-phoneme patterns).
  - Child drags tiles, app segments multi-letter sounds (/sh/ + /i/ + /p/), child blends aloud, parent grades.
- Sessions mix Word Reading (CVC + CCVC) + Blend Complex Words + Letter-Sound reviews (World 1 in deep maintenance, World 2 words in maintenance).
- Digraph/blend completion logic: when child hits ≥90% accuracy on 20 digraph-based words, World 3 is ready for quests.

## Why This Order
You've proven CVC decoding works. Now you test whether adding multi-phoneme patterns (digraphs/blends) works within the same SR framework. This is a critical step because it's where complexity increases meaningfully.

## Validation Criteria
- **Pedagogical:** Can kids apply blending to more complex patterns? Does SR help?
- **Architecture:** Do multi-phoneme items break the SR engine or quest generator?
- **Engagement:** Are the more complex words engaging or frustrating?
