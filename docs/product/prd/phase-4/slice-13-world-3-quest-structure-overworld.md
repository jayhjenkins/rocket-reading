# Slice 13: World 3 Quest Structure & Overworld

## Overview
Wrap World 3 digraph/blend mini-games in quests, unlock new world locations (Forest Path, Robot Factory, etc.).

## Contents
- Overworld expands with 3 new locations (in addition to World 1/2 areas):
  1. **Forest Path** – Navigation quest: "Read the signs to find your way!" → Word Reading (digraph/blend words).
  2. **Robot Factory** – Password quest: "Build passwords with the right letter tiles!" → Blend Complex Words mini-game.
  3. **Boat Dock** – Sorting quest: "Which boats have words starting with /sh/?" → Word Reading + categorization.
- Quest generator pulls due digraph/blend words, wraps them thematically.
- World state persists: forest path clears, robots unlock, boat fleet grows.
- Sessions are ~10–15 minutes (mixing World 1 maintenance + World 2 words + World 3 new patterns).
- Parent dashboard updated to show "Digraphs & Blends" as a new skill strand.

## Why This Order
You've proven digraph/blend mini-games work. Now you validate they integrate into full quests without overwhelming kids or breaking the quest generator. World 3 locations should feel distinctly more "advanced" than Worlds 1 & 2.

## Validation Criteria
- **Fun:** Do World 3 quests feel like a natural step-up in complexity?
- **Architecture:** Does the quest generator handle mixed complexity (World 1 + 2 + 3 items together)?
- **Engagement:** Are kids ready for longer sessions, or is fatigue setting in?
