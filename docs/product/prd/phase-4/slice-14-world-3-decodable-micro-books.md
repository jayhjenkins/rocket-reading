# Slice 14: World 3 Decodable Micro-Books

## Overview
3–5 decodable micro-books using digraphs, blends, and CVC vocabulary.

## Contents
- Create 3–5 micro-books using CVC words + digraph/blend words + high-frequency words (the, is, a, my, and).
- Examples: "The Ship," "Fish in a Shop," "Stop at the Street," "I Plant a Tree."
- Each book: 1–3 pages, 2–5 words per page, bright illustrations.
- Child reads the book; parent or system checks comprehension (tap matching picture or simple question).
- Successful reads unlock book in the Treehouse bookshelf.
- Books can use **personalization** (if decodable, e.g., "I see a truck" if "truck" is in the child's decodable set).
- Sessions optionally end with choosing a micro-book to read.

## Why This Order
World 3 is pedagogically about *blending patterns*, not just CVC. Micro-books prove that kids can apply digraph/blend decoding to connected text. This validates the complexity step-up and preps for World 4's sentence focus.

## Validation Criteria
- **Pedagogical:** Can kids read connected text with digraphs/blends? Does it reinforce pattern knowledge?
- **Engagement:** Do kids feel proud mastering more complex words?
- **Architecture:** Does the book system scale with increased word complexity?
