# Slice 2: Complete World 1 Content & Item Library

## Overview
All of World 1 (Sounds & Shapes) content + SR items + a second mini-game type.

## Contents
- Expand SR items to **8–12 letters** (the full World 1 starter set: m, a, t, s, p, i, n, o, e, r, etc.).
- Add a second mini-game: **Sound → Letter (Recognition)** – app says "Tap the letter that says /s/," child taps from 3–4 letter tiles.
- Sessions now do ~3–5 minutes, mixing both mini-game types with SR scheduling.
- World 1 completion logic: when child hits ≥90% accuracy on all 12 letters, World 1 is "done," and they unlock World 2.
- Overworld has a simple **Treehouse** scene with one NPC (e.g., a mascot); no quests yet, just mini-games.

## Why This Order
You now have a full letter-set and two complementary mini-games (production + recognition). This is still not "game-like" (no quests, no world state), but it's a complete pedagogical unit. You can test whether 8–12 letters with real SR spacing actually teaches letter-sound knowledge.

## Validation Criteria
- **Pedagogical:** Does SR spacing for 12 letters actually work? Do kids retain better with spacing than cramming?
- **Engagement:** Can we keep sessions fun with just two mini-game types? Or is it already boring?
- **Architecture:** Does adding more items + another mini-game type break anything? Can the SR engine handle 20–30 items per session?
